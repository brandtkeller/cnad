      <h1>Definition of an Airgapped Computing Environment</h1>
      <p>
        An <strong>airgapped computing environment</strong> is a network or system
        that is physically isolated from unsecured or public networks, including the
        Internet. This isolation prevents external connectivity, thereby significantly
        reducing the risk of cyberattacks, data exfiltration, or unauthorized remote
        access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Airgapped systems are commonly used in defense, critical infrastructure,
        financial systems, and other high-security environments. They rely on
        controlled transfer mechanisms, such as removable media or approved
        gateways, to move data in and out of the environment. Strict policies,
        auditing, and monitoring are applied to maintain integrity and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key characteristics include:
        <ul>
          <li>No direct connection to the Internet or external networks</li>
          <li>Restricted physical and logical access</li>
          <li>Controlled data ingress/egress processes</li>
          <li>Focus on confidentiality, integrity, and resilience</li>
        </ul>
